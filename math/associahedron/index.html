<h1><a href="/math/associahedron/">Associahedra</a></h1>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associahedron">Associahedra</a> are a very mathematically deep family of polytopes (one in each dimension) that occur frequently in combinatorics, under many different interpretations. A fascinating fact about them is that the coefficients of the multiplicate inverse of a power series encode the polyhedra face data of the Associahedra (see Marcelo Aguiar and Frederico Ardilla's <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.07504">paper</a>.</p>
<p>Here's an interactive 3D web app of the first 7. They're all projected to R^3, and K_5 is the family member that naturally lives in R^3. I made this with the help of this <a href="https://github.com/vasturiano/3d-force-graph">3D-Force-Graph</a> library.</p>

<h2>Comments on the app</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Click and drag to rotate the figure. You can zoom in and out and also hover over the nodes to see what binary word it corresponds to. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can use the slider to change which Associahedron you look at. I have the data for K_8, K_9, and K_10, but displaying them has made my browser crash.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can toggle the Binary Words option to literally see what binary word corresponds to each node.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can toggle the Arrows to further understand the combinatorial interpretation. I interpret an arrow as shifting the parenthesis of a binary word once to the left. Thus, you'll notice the binary word with its parentheses all to the left have arrows point <em>to</em> it, and the binary word with its parentheses all to the right have arrows pointing <em>from</em> it. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>I came across the associahedra during my undergraduate thesis, which involved obtaining a true understanding of Mac Lane's Coherence theorem and Mac Lane's proof, so that I could spell the whole thing out in a organized manner once and for all. This was actually due to a lack of finding satisfactory resources that explained Mac Lane's proof. Resources that attempted to explain it were either wrong, hand-waved, or simply copying Mac Lane's language without putting it in their own words. (I came to understand why this is, and it's because it's a very, very long, subtle, time consuming, but not terribly hard proof). It dawned on me that nobody who had taken the time to truly understand it wrote about their understanding. I thought that was unfortunate because it's a frequently cited result and it states a very important, powerful idea in category theory. </p>
<p>Interestingly, in Mac Lane's proof, he does not mention at all the connection that his proof had with the associahedra. He most definitely knew there was a connection (I would bet that he had spoken with or knew of Jim Stasheff, who wrote about the associahedra, since they worked in related areas), but I do wonder why he didn't mention it.</p>
<p>Here are some further things you can look at.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>My thesis <a href="https://scholarship.claremont.edu/hmc_theses/243/">A Coherent Proof of Mac Lane's Coherence Theorem</a>. It is for anyone who ever needs to really understand each exact details of Mac Lane's proof, or anyone who is just curious about the details. Here's a nice picture of K_5 that I produced in my thesis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="">Presentation slides I made that I used for an end-of-year presentation explaining my thesis work.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="">The raw polyhedra face data of the associahedra in JSON format</a>, as well as <a href="">the python code that generated the data here</a>. It was a quite a pain to generate and verify to be correct, so I hope if someone needs this data they can find it here before going through the trouble of generating it again.</p>
