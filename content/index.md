Hi! My name is Luke Trujillo and you've found my website. 

I like math, Linux things, and programming (Python, C, some C++). Here is some stuff you can look at. 

* [TikzPy](/cs/tikzpy/), a Python package I wrote for generating TikZ code (a LaTeX thing) programmatically, which I did because TikZ is powerful graphics library but it's extremely tedious to use.

* [An Introductory text on Category Theory](/static/cat_theory.pdf). This is a 400 page math textbook I wrote during my undergrad since it tied together a lot of math things I was learning at the time (algebra, topology, geometry). 

* [A Coherent Proof of Mac Lane's Coherence Theorem](https://scholarship.claremont.edu/hmc_theses/243/). This is my undergrad thesis that fills in the lengthy details of Saunder Mac Lane's slick proof of the Coherence Theorem, which were basically nonexistent in literal writing before. You can use [these slides](/static/thesis_presentation.pdf) for an overview of that, and you can find a web app I made in finding a connection to geometry in the proof [here](/math/associahedron/).

* [Some algebra notes](/static/algebra.pdf) on Group, Ring, and Module theory from my earlier undergrad time.

* You can access my CV [here](/static/cv.pdf).
