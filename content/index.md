Hi! My name is Luke and you've found my website.

Here is some stuff you can look at. 

* [A Python package](/cs/tikzpy/) for generating TikZ code (a LaTeX thing), which I did because TikZ is powerful but very tedious to use.

* [An Introductory text on Category Theory](https://ltrujello.github.io/cat_book/cat_theory.pdf). This is a 400 page document that I spent hundreds of hours on during my undergrad since it tied together a lot of things I was learning at the time. 

* [A Coherent Proof of Mac Lane's Coherence Theorem](https://scholarship.claremont.edu/hmc_theses/243/), my undergrad thesis. The title is somewhat a play on words, as the thesis work was on clarifying a known result in category theory because the original proof left many details to the reader, and I could not find anywhere in academic literature or on the internet of anyone supplying these details themselves. You can read more about that and play with this web app I made as part of my thesis [here](/math/associahedron/).

* You can access my CV [here](/cv/cv.pdf).
