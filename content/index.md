Hi! My name is Luke Trujillo and you've found my website. 

I like math, Linux things, and programming (Python, C++). Here is some stuff you can look at. 

* [A Python package](/cs/tikzpy/) for generating TikZ code (a LaTeX thing), which I did because TikZ is powerful but very tedious to use.

* [An Introductory text on Category Theory](/static/cat_theory.pdf). This is a 400 page document that I spent hundreds of hours on during my undergrad since it tied together a lot of things I was learning at the time. 

* [A Coherent Proof of Mac Lane's Coherence Theorem](https://scholarship.claremont.edu/hmc_theses/243/), my undergrad thesis. You can read more about that and play with this web app I made as part of my thesis [here](/math/associahedron/).

* [Some algebra notes](/static/algebra.pdf) on Group, Ring, and Module theory from my earlier undergrad time.

* You can access my CV [here](/static/cv.pdf).
