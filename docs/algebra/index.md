# Algebra Notes

## What is this? 
<img src="../../../png/algebra/algebra.png" style="float: right; width:40%; margin-left:10px;"/>
These are notes on topics in algebra, including group theory, ring theory, and module theory, that 
I wrote and maintained throughout my math undergraduate education. 

This is the html version rendered. If you'd like the original LaTeX PDF version, see here.
In PDF format, this totals to about 150 pages of notes.

## Motivation

The material here covers about a semester and a half worth of algebra courses, starting from group theory and ending in module theory.
A lot of this material was inspired from lecture notes, homework assignments, and course exams I took (of course no actual duplication of exam material).
