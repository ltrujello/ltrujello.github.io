# Algebra Notes

These are notes on general algebra that I wrote and maintained throughout my math undergraduate education. 

This is the html version rendered via MathJax. If you'd like the original LaTeX PDF version, see here.

The material here 
covers about a semester and a half worth of algebra courses, starting from group theory and ending in module theory.
A lot of this material was inspired from lecture notes, homework assignments, and course exams I took
(of course no actual duplication of exam material).
