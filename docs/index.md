Hi, my name is Luke and you've found my website. Here you can find stuff I've made that I hope can be useful. 

I enjoy working on things that make it faster and easier for others to dessiminate and understand
technical information. 

My undergraduate education focused on pure math, specifically in relation to algebra, 
topology, and category theory, and I studied these areas deeply under many wonderfully patient 
math profs. However, these days my interests reside more in neural networks, 
specifically with regard to neural translation and computer vision.
